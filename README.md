# Power BI Sales & Operations Dashboard (Northwind Traders)

This project is a 2-page executive dashboard built in Power BI, analyzing sales, customer, employee, and supplier data from the Northwind Traders dataset.

## 🚀 Project Goal
The goal was to transform raw data from 8 different CSV files into a single, interactive, and "attractive" report. The dashboard is designed for executives to get a high-level overview of the business and for managers to drill down into internal operations.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Modeling:** Connected 8 separate CSVs (Orders, Products, Employees, etc.) by creating relationships in the Power BI data model.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Wrote DAX to create new calculated columns, including:
    * `LineTotal` (to calculate revenue)
    * `ShippingDuration` (to find the average shipping time)
    * `ManagerName` (to build the employee hierarchy)
* **Data Visualization:** Used 15 different visuals across two pages to answer specific business questions (e.g., Maps, Line Charts, Histograms, Matrix).
* **UI/UX Design:** Focused on user experience by:
    * Using an "Onyx" dark theme.
    * Creating a "card" effect for all visuals (backgrounds, borders, shadows).
    * Aligning all visuals into a clean, professional grid.<img width="1444" height="811" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-02 113803" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a1792f-d332-4efa-9fd5-cd21c21ec1cf" />
